<p id="description">An BPL auction is an event that takes place annually where the players bid to purchase players to add them to the T20 match. The auctioning process occurs every year since the establishment of the Bangladesh Premier League. It is conducted by the BCB to auction the players to various franchises. The franchises bid for the listed players and end with a settled squad for every BPL team. Though it is a two-day event the franchises research many things before bidding for the players.

<h2>üßê Features:</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   With Tailwind you style elements by applying pre-existing classes directly in your HTML. By using utility classes in this way you can build custom designs without writing CSS.
*   Node JS Has Rich Ecosystem and NPM Node.js has a rich ecosystem of modules and libraries available through the Node Package Manager (NPM). With over a million packages NPM provides solutions for almost every conceivable problem significantly speeding up the development process.
*   Node JS Offers Real-Time Applications The speed of Node.js is particularly beneficial for real-time applications such as chat applications gaming servers and collaboration tools. Its ability to handle a high volume of short-lived connections makes it ideal for these use cases.
*   Hot Reloading: React Native introduces the concept of ‚ÄúHot Reloading‚Äù allowing developers to see the immediate results of the code changes without restarting the entire application. This feature accelerates the development process by providing a faster feedback loop enhancing productivity and enabling developers to iterate quickly.
*   Reusable Components: React Native promotes the concept of reusable components enabling developers to build modular and scalable applications. Components can be easily reused across different parts of the app or even in entirely different projects. This not only streamlines development but also ensures consistency in design and functionality.
*   Lazy loading of modules : Vite implements lazy-loading of modules which means that code is only loaded when it is actually needed. This results in smaller bundle sizes and improved performance especially for larger applications. Lazy loading also allows for faster initial load times for your users as the code for non-critical parts of your application is only loaded when required.
